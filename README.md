## About Polimbo
Polimbo was created as part of Rhizome's annual [Seven on Seven](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2017/apr/21/seven-on-seven-2017/) event in 2017, which pairs seven leading artists with seven visionary technologists, and challenges them to make something new — an artwork, a prototype, whatever they imagine. 

A collaboration between [DIS](https://dis.art/) & [Rachel Haot](https://rachelhaot.com/), the Polimbo app evokes Tinder by allowing users to swipe right or left on a series of speculative scenarios tied to real-world public policy, in this case net neutrality and its rollback, and ultimately “matching” them with like-minded politicians.
